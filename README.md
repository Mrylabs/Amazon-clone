🛒 Amazon Clone (Practice Project)

A practice project where I’m building an **Amazon-style storefront** to strengthen my **JavaScript** skills.  
The base design came from a template, but all **JavaScript functionality** is written by me.

---

🚀 Features I’ve Built
- 🟢 **Add to Cart button** → products can be added dynamically.  
- 🟢 **Cart quantity updates** → cart icon shows live item count.  
- 🟢 **Organized files with Git/GitHub** → clean commit history, version control.  

---

📂 Main Files
- `amazon.html` → storefront page (my main work).  
- `scripts/` → my JavaScript logic (cart + interactivity).  
- `data/` → product info used by JS.  
- Other folders (`backend/`, `styles/`, `images/`, extra HTML pages) → part of the original design template, kept for future expansion.

📌 Roadmap
Next improvements:
- Modularize JavaScript code.  
- Add OOP concepts (classes for products & cart).  
- Testing framework setup.  
- Connect a backend.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- **JavaScript (focus)**  
- HTML/CSS (template)
